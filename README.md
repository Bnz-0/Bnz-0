# Why I quit github?

Because it's fucking slow.

... and also because \
it's closed source but my code is not, \
it's profit-oriented but my code is not, \
it's suuuper slow (and hopefully my code is not), \
its ux is terrible, \
its features are sold like ads (especially ai ones), \
requires a 2023+ machine to open a fucking page in human time, \
requires js to open a fucking page \
and finally, it's dumb slow.

You can find the active repos moved on codeberg: https://codeberg.org/bnz

Only few repos will remain here on github (shared ownership, forks, and [fuk-u-teams](https://github.com/Bnz-0/fuk-u-teams) because it's too funny that microslop serve this) and are the ones not archived.

P.s. Almost forgot to say that this shit is slow as fuck.
